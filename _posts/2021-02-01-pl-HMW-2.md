# Second HMW DNA Extraction for Pac-Bio Sequencing of _Pocillopora meandrina_ Flash Frozen Tissue Chunk

In this process I use the [QIAGEN Genomic-tip 100/G](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/qiagen-genomic-tip-100g/#orderinginformation), the [QIAGEN Genomic DNA Buffer Set](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/blood-and-cell-culture-dna-midi-kit/#orderinginformation), [QIAGEN RNase A (100mg/mL concentration)](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/lab-essentials/enzymes/rnase-a/?clear=true#orderinginformation), [QIAGEN Proteinase K](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/lab-essentials/enzymes/qiagen-proteinase-k/?clear=true#orderinginformation), and [DNA lo-bind tubes](https://online-shop.eppendorf.us/US-en/Laboratory-Consumables-44512/Tubes-44515/DNA-LoBind-Tubes-PF-56252.html)


**Goal**: Get good quality HMW DNA from this sample, at least 6ug (to add to 19ug from the [previous extraction](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/pm-hmw/))  
**Result**: 28ug of DNA, with a little smearing  
**Major Take Aways**: This is more than enough DNA, and the quality is really good, larger fragments than the first extraction, so I think we should use this extraction to send to sequence

**Set up**

- Prepared digestion buffer with 9.5mL of Buffer G2 and 19ul of RNase A
- Set incubator genie to 50 degrees C
- Cleaned scraper/scooper with 10% bleach, DI water, then 70% EtOH
- Wrapped those in foil and placed in -80
- Also placed mortar and pestle in -80
- Had styrofoam cooler of dry ice saved from a shipment and filled Thermoflask dewar with LN2
- Brought over scale
- Set up dry ice box for keeping the conical and scraper chilled while grinding

**Grinding and Incubation**

- Picked out chunk with a good amount of tissue on it
- Tared the scale with the chilled mortar on it
- Put in the chunk and weighed: 1.55g
- Poured LN2 into mortar and let boil off
- Ground chunk until it was a powder. It was very hard to grind as the skeleton is very dense, I used LN2 two more times and really smashed the frozen tissue
- Scrapped into a chilled 50mL conical with the scraper
- Poured in the buffer G2 mix
- Vortexed briefly
- Added 500ul of Proteinase K and vortexed again, then spun down breifly
- Put the conical in the incubator genie at 50 degrees C rocking 15 speed for 2 hours

### Genomic Tip Extraction

**Genomic Tip**

- Set centrifuge to 4 degrees C
- After incubation, transferred 1mL of lysed tissue liquid into each of 9 1.5mL tubes with wide bore pipette tips
- Centrifuged at 4 degrees C for 10 minutes at 5000 rcf to pellet any extra stuff
- Set up tip (resin column) inside a holder over a 50mL conical
- While that was going, added 4mL of equilibration buffer (QBT) to the tip and let drip through to the conical (took the 10 min)
- After centrifugation sample image, notice there was a small white pellet of debris in each tube, but not a lot
- Added the supernatant from the sample tubes to the resin tip with  wide bore pipette tip and let drip through
- Dripping took ~16 min
- Changed 50mL waste conicals
- Added 7.5mL of buffer QC (wash) and let drip through (10min)
- Pipetted 5mL of buffer QF into a 5mL tube and warmed in incubator genie to 50 degrees C
- Repeated wash addition (10 minutes)
- Transferred resin tip to a different 50mL conical
- Added the 5mL of warmed buffer QF and let drip through (10 minutes)

**Isopropanol Precipitation of DNA**

- Made 6 DNA lo-bind 1.5mL tubes, 5 each with 833ul of the elution liquid, the last tube was about 680ul
- Added 583ul (0.7 volumes) of room temp 100% isopropanol to each of the first 5 tubes and 476ul to the 6th tube
- Gently inverted to mix
- Centrifuged all lo-bind tubes at 10,000 rcf for 30 minutes at 1 degree C
- Made fresh 70% EtOH and placed in -20 freezer to cool down
- Once finished, looked for pellets: there was a barely visible white pellet in each tube
- One tube at a time, removed most of the supernatant
- One tube at a time, added 1mL of cold 70% EtOH and vortexed briefly
- Centrifuged tubes for 10 minutes at 4 degrees C 10,000 rcf
- Removed all of supernatant when finished, used a p200 to get small volumes out, pellets were still visible
- Let tubes air dry ~7 minutes
- Added 50ul of TE buffer to each of the 6 tubes very gently
- Incubated for 1hr at 55 degrees C in the Theremomixer
- Once done, transferred to a shaker for 1 hour 300rpm
- Once done, tubes were placed in the fridge for the weekend

### QC 2021 02 01

**Qubit**

- Broad Range Qubit the Monday morning ([protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Protocols/Qubit-Assay-Protocol.md))
- Tubes were taken out of the fridge and placed on the shaker at 300 rpm for ~30 min while the qubit standards came to room temp
- Flicked tube and took from both top T and bottom B of the tube measurements

|Standard 1|Standard 2|Sample|Average DNA ng/Âµl| Averaged top and bottom ng/ul|
|---|----|----|----|---|
|179 RFU|19529 RFU|7 T|84.6||
|-|-|7 B|85.3|84.95|
|-|-|8 T|87.1||

**Genomic DNA TapeStation**

- Followed Tapestation [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/DNA-Tapestation/)
- [Results link](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/tapestation_pdfs/2021-02-01%20-%2009.44.06.pdf)
- Most of the DNA is HMW, there is very minimal smearing, and the ladder worked perfectly

**Total Amount of DNA from this extraction based on average top and bottom Qubit values and ~47ul of sample volume in each tube**
- 7: 3992.65ng DNA
- 8: 4119.55ng DNA
- 9: 5076ng DNA
- 10: 5510.75ng DNA
- 11: 5076ng DNA
- 12: 4935ng DNA
- **TOTAL: 28709.95ng DNA or 28.7ug of DNA**
