# Using [Larvae Extraction Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Larvae-Ex-Protocol/) on 12 of Ariana's _Montipora_ Coral Larvae Stored in DNA/RNA Shield

**Goal:** Use optimized extraction method on 12 samples for Ariana's project and elute the three samples above D29 in only 70ul of ultrapure water instead of 100ul
**Results:** Good DNA and RNA quantity and quality, RNA purity is not very good
**Take aways**: Purity of RNA is not very good, there seems to be no correlation with if the wash buffer is new or not, considering I used the same as the last extraction this time. Maybe I get worse purity the more samples I do at once
