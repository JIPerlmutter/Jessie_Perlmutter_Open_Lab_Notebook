# Using the Zymo Pico Methyl Seq Library Prep Kit For 1 Re-Do _Montipora_ DNA Samples from KBay Project

**Goal** Re-do sample 18 library prep, resuspend final libraries in a larger volume
**Results** Prep worked perfectly this time
**Takeaways** I increased all final wash spin times to 3 minutes to make sure no wash buffer carryover occured

### This library prep followed the closely [the protocol for the Zymo Pico Methyl Seq Kit from me](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/WGBS-PMS-protocol/). See that protocol for detailed descriptions of each steps. Tables and values specific for this prep are included below.


**I used the same dilution for sample 18 as made in the [previous post](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Kbay-WGBS-3rd/)**

#### Bisulfite Conversion

- Followed exact steps as in protocol
- Put samples in fridge overnight

#### Post-BS Conversion cleanup 20210521
- Followed exact steps as in the protocol, except increasing final wash spin to 3 minutes

#### Amplification with Prep-Amp Primers
- Followed exact steps as in the protocol
- Priming
  - 2ul PrepAmp Buffer
  - 1ul PrepAmp Primer
- PrepAmp
  - 1ul PrepAmp Buffer
  - 3.75ul PrepAmp PreMix
  - 0.3ul PrepAmp Polymerase
- PrepAmp Polymerase addition: 0.3ul

#### DNA Clean and Concentrator
- Followed exact steps as in the protocol, except increasing final wash spin to 3 minutes

#### First Amplification  
- Followed exact steps as in the protocol
- 1st Amp
  - 12.5ul Library Amp Mix
  - 1ul Library Amp Primers

#### Second DNA Clean and Concentrator
- Followed exact steps as in the protocol, except increasing final wash spin to 3 minutes

#### Second Amplification with Index Primers
- Followed exact steps as in the protocol, except I used the KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready Mix instead of the Library Amp Mix and I used only 13ul of it, and that the indexes had been combined so I only used 1ul of the combined indexes

| Extraction-ID | DNA Volume | KAPA Mix Volume | Primer Pair | Volume Primer |
|---------------|------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| 18            | 12ul       | 13ul            | 36          | 1ul           |

#### 1X Bead Clean
- Followed exact steps as in protocol
- Samples were Qubited immediately so they were put on an ice bucket not frozen yet

#### Broad Range dsDNA Qubit
- Followed [Qubit protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Protocols/Qubit-Assay-Protocol.md)

|Sample|Reading 1 (ng/ul)|Reading 2(ng/ul)|Average (ng/ul)|
|---|---|---|---|
|S1|184 RFU|-|-|
|S2|20393 RFU|-|-|
|18|31|30.8|30.9|

#### D5000 TapeStation
- Followed [TapeStation protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/DNA-Tapestation/)
- [Results Link](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/tapestation_pdfs/2021-06-03%20-%2014.14.26.pdf)
