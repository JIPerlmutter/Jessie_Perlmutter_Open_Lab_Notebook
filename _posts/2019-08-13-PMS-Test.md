### Testing [Zymo Pico Methyl Seq Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/pico-methyl-seq-library-prep-kit) On Bisulfite Converted Samples from [Previous Post](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/BS-Test/)

_Note: using version 1.2 of the kit manual_

**Amplification with PrepAmp Primers**

- Made Priming master mix on ice:
  - 2µl 5X PrepAmp buffer * 4.2 = 8.4µl
  - 1µl PrepAmp Primers (40µM) * 4.2 = 4.2µl
- Made new PCR tubes with 3µl of PrepAmp MM and 7µl of bisulfite treated DNA (221 and 1431 captured and not captured)
- Kept those on ice
- Made PrepAmp Mix on ice:
  - 1µl 5X PrepAmp buffer * 4.2 = 4.2µl
  - 3.75µl PrepAmp PreMix * 4.2 = 15.75µl
  - 0.3µl PrepAmp polymerase * 4.2 = 1.26µl
- Set thermocylcer program with lid temp restricted to 25 degrees C and place samples inside and run:
  - 98 for 2 minutes
  - 8 degrees for 1 minute
  - 8 degree hold
  - **During hold vortex, spin tubes down, add 5.05µl PrepAmp Mix to each tube, vortex, spin down, and place back in thermocycler**
  - 8 degrees for 4 minutes
  - 16 degrees for 1 minute with 3% ramp rate
  - 22 degrees for 1 minute with 3% ramp rate
  - 28 degrees for 1 minute with 3% ramp rate
  - 36 degrees for 1 minute with 3% ramp rate
  - 36.5 degrees for 1 minute with 3% ramp rate
  - 37 degrees for 8 minutes
  - repeat back from the first step one time through again
  - **During hold, vortex, spin tubes down, add 0.3µl PrepAmp Polymerase to each tube, vortex, spin down, and place back into thermocycler**

**Cleanup with DNA Clean and Concentrator Columns (DCC)**

- Made a 1.5mL tube for each sample, added 7:1 ratio DNA binding buffer, so 105.49µl of DNA binding buffer
- Put elution buffer in thermomixer 56 degrees
- Added DNA sample (15.07µl) to the appropriate 1.5mL tube
- Vortexed, spun down, and added to the column
- Centrifuged 12,000 rcf 30 seconds, discarded flowthrough
- Added 200µl M-wash buffer to each column
- Centrifuged 12,000 rcf 30 seconds, discarded flowthrough
- Added 200µl M-wash buffer to each column
- Centrifuged 12,000 rcf 30 seconds, discarded flowthrough
- Transferred columns to 1.5mL tubes
- Added 12µl warmed elution buffer to each column directly
- Incubated 1 minute
- Centrifuged 12,000 rcf 30 seconds

**First Amplification (Adapter addition?)**

- Made 1st Amp master mix:
 - 12.5µl 2X Library Amp Mix * 4.2 = 52.5µl
 - 1µl Library Amp Primer(10µM) * 4.2 = 4.2µl
- Added 13.5µl MM to new PCR tubes
- Added 11.5µl of cleaned and concentrated DNA sample to the appropriate new PCR tube
- Vortexed, spun down, and placed in thermocycler program 1st Pico Methyl Amp program

**Cleanup with DCC**

- Made a 1.5mL tube for each sample, added 7:1 ratio DNA binding buffer, so 175µl of DNA binding buffer
- Put elution buffer in thermomixer 56 degrees
- Added DNA sample (25µl) to the appropriate 1.5mL tube
- Vortexed, spun down, and added to the column
- Centrifuged 12,000 rcf 30 seconds, discarded flowthrough
- Added 200µl M-wash buffer to each column
- Centrifuged 12,000 rcf 30 seconds, discarded flowthrough
- Added 200µl M-wash buffer to each column
- Centrifuged 12,000 rcf 30 seconds, discarded flowthrough
- Transferred columns to 1.5mL tubes
- Added 12.5µl warmed elution buffer to each column directly
- Incubated 1 minute
- Centrifuged 12,000 rcf 30 seconds

**Amplification with Index Primers**

- Made new PCR tubes for each sample with 12.5µl Library Amp Mix
- Added indexed primers:
  - 221 Captured got 0.5µl Index A
  - 1431 Captured got 0.5µl Index B
  - 221 Not-Captured got 0.5µl Index C
  - 1431 Not-Captured got 0.5µl Index D
- Added 12µl of sample to the appropriate tube (all of the flowthrough from above DCC) _note, 1431 captured had more that 12µl in the tube, potentially wash buffer that did not full come out? All of that sample was added to the tube for amplification._
- Vortexed, spun down, and placed in theremocycler program 2nd Pico Methyl Amp program

**Cleanup with DCC**

- Made a 1.5mL tube for each sample, added 7:1 ratio DNA binding buffer, so 175µl of DNA binding buffer
- Put elution buffer in thermomixer 56 degrees
- Added DNA sample (25µl) to the appropriate 1.5mL tube
- Vortexed, spun down, and added to the column
- Centrifuged 12,000 rcf 30 seconds, discarded flowthrough
- Added 200µl M-wash buffer to each column
- Centrifuged 12,000 rcf 30 seconds, discarded flowthrough
- Added 200µl M-wash buffer to each column
- Centrifuged 12,000 rcf 30 seconds, discarded flowthrough
- Transferred columns to 1.5mL tubes
- Added 12µl warmed elution buffer to each column directly
- Incubated 1 minute
- Centrifuged 12,000 rcf 30 seconds

_Slightly more than 12µl seemed to come out of 221 not-captured, more wash buffer carryover?_

**D5000 TapeStation**

- [Protocol]() for D5000 tapestation followed exactly
- Sample 1431 Captured did not show anything in the tapestation, see [full results](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/tapestation_pdfs/2019-08-13%20-%2013.28.21.pdf))

![TS]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/221-cap-lib.png "TS")

![TS2]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/221-nc-lib.png "TS2")

![T3]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/1431-nc-lib.png "TS3")

Each one looks different, where potentially 221 captured looks the most like what I think of when I think library, but the others look more like the example in the kit manual. However 221 not-captured does have a long shoulder of larger DNA that was not present in any previous tapestations of that sample....
