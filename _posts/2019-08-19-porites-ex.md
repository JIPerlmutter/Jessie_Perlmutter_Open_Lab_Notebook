## Extracting DNA and RNA from Porites astreoides corals for genome project to use the RNA for new Zymo Ribo-free RNASeq test kit

**Samples**

G1-4  
G1-13  
Hot # 3 1/2 salinity  
TA-Amb 1  
TA-Amb 2  
TA-HOT 2  

Followed exact [protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/Zymo-DNA-RNA-Extract-P.astreoides-Genome/) Kevin Wong had done previously on other samples for these corals

_Note: very hard to remove tissue from these corals, did not scrape or chip off easily and some were wet/mucousy even though they were taken quickly from the -80_

**Qubit, Gel and TapeStation**

[Qubit](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/), [gel](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Gel-Protocol/), and [tapestation](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/RNA-TapeStation-Protocol/) were all done by Erin Chille on 8-20-19

Qubit:  

_all values are in ng/ul_
