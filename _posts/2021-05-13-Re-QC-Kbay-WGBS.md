# Dilute and Re-QC WGBS Libraries from [This Post](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Kbay-WGBS-1/) Because of High Concentration and Potential Overloading of the TapeStation

**Goal** Add extra volume of elution buffer and re-do QC metrics  
**Results** Concentrations are still high, tape looks slightly better/easier to read
**Takeaways** I plan to now elute all KAPA-2nd amp libraries with 35ul elution buffer after the bead cleanup

**I took the existing libraries, thawed them, and added 16ul of DNA elution buffer to each**

Then I re-did the Qubit (concentration had changed), and the TapeStation.

**Broad Range dsDNA Qubit**
- Followed [Qubit protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Protocols/Qubit-Assay-Protocol.md)
