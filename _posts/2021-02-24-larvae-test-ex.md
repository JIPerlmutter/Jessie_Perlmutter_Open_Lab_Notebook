# Testing DNA/RNA Extraction and Bead or Pestle Homogenization Protocol on _Acropora hyacinthus_ Larvae

**Goal**: Develop a good protocol and homogenization method for coral larvae/eggs preserved in DNA/RNA Shield. The goal is to get high quality and amount of DNA and RNA from these samples  
**Results**: Low quality RNA, pretty degraded, but purity is ok and amount is good. DNA amount and quality pretty good. No difference in quality between homogenization methods, although yield is higher for the pestle smashed samples  
**Take-aways**: Neither method seems good so far considering the poor RNA quality. Potentially not all the samples were preserved properly (see below), and that could have caused degradation prior to extraction. Additionally poor homogenization in both tests could have caused problems. However homogenization was worse in the pestle samples, and the quality is the same. Or incubation with proK could have caused degradation, however it was at room temp.

### Samples and Protocol Notes

- Samples used are _Arcopora hyacinthus_ larvae collected in Mo'orea on 20201112, stored in 1.5mL tubes and 1000ul of DNA/RNA Sheild, frozen at -80:
  - A5_1
  - A5_2
  - A5_3
  - A5_4
- My goal was to follow the [Zymo DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus kit protocol](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf). This is the most recent version, updated in January 2021, suggests homogenization with beads and a room temp incubation with proteinase K for 30 minutes (could be extended). [Previous extractions](https://echille.github.io/E.-Chille-Open-Lab-Notebook/Protocol-for-DNA-RNA-Extractions-of-Montipora-Coral-Larvae-Using-Zymo-Duet-Extraction-Kit/) used heated digestions with proteinase K, however Zymo has changed their product since then and the heated digestions have failed recently (probably since they changed the protocol or product. However all the buffers are named the same so it's difficult to tell what changed).
- I also tried two different methods for homogenization: bead beating in the Tissuelyser with glass beads, and using a small disposable plastic pestle to smash the larvae by hand

### Homogenization

- Thawed samples on ice bucket
  - I noticed that in each sample, some of the larvae were stuck up on the side of the tube not in the shield liquid:

A5_2

A5_3

A5_4

- After thawing, poured 1/2 of a glass bead tube into each of A5_1 and A5_2
- Homogenized A5_1 and A5_2 in the Tissuelyser at 25Hz for 2 minutes
- After checking, there still seemed to be tissue left un-broken up in the samples. Additionally A5_2 had opened a little in the machine and lost some volume

- Homogenized the two tubes again for 2 minutes at 25Hz
- Homogenization seemed more complete and there were less flakes in the tubes, bubbles had to be centrifuged down in the minifuge

- Cleaned 2 plastic pestles with 10% bleach, DI water, 70% ethanol, and RNaseZap
- Used the cleaned pestles to hand-homogenize samples A5_3 and A5_4. I spent ~3-4 minutes on each tube: smashing, swirling, etc. The larvae float so it was hard to break them down. Additionally the liquid volume was a little high and some bubbled over onto my gloves. Gloves were changed between samples. After 4 minutes on each sample, I decided that was a reasonable effort even though not all of it had broken up.  
A5_3

A5_4  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/master/images/A50-PESTLE2.jpg)  
- To each tube: added 100ul of pro K digestion buffer and 50ul of proteinase K
- Vortexed and spun down tubes. _Here I noticed that the pestle homogenized tubes were less broken down than I had thought. Because they got so bubbly, I did not see un-broken up larvae floating at the top of the tubes_
- Placed the tubes in the thermomixer set to **23 degrees C** this is room temp, and 800rpm for 30 minutes
- After pro k incubation, the samples looked more broken down

A5_2

A5_3

A5_4

- I wanted to try to pellet any left over debris, so I centrifuged the tubes for 1 minute at 5,000rcf (g)
- After centrifugation, there was a visible fatty layer of debris at the liquid line in each tube, as well as some pelleted debris:

A5_2

A5_3

A5_4  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/master/images/A504-3.jpg)  
- I transferred the "supernatant" to new 5mL tubes, trying to avoid the bottom and top debris. The lipid layer at the top did get partially sucked up in all samples. Volumes from each sample (note A5_2 and pestle tubes had lost volume during homogenization):
  - 1: 1000ul
  - 2: 700ul
  - 3: 950ul
  - 4: 900ul
- The previous tubes were discarded

- Vortexted and spun down tubes
- Added 700ul of that liquid to a yellow spin column for each sample
- Centrifuged at 16,000 rcf for 30 seconds

- Added 400ul wash buffer to each spin column
- Centrifuged at 16,000 rcf for 30 seconds
- Poured off flowthrough into kit waste beaker
- Created the DNase mix:
  - 4 * 75ul DNA digestion buffer = 300ul
  - 4 * 5ul DNase I = 20ul
- Added 80ul of the DNase mix to each tube and incubated at room temp for 15 minutes
