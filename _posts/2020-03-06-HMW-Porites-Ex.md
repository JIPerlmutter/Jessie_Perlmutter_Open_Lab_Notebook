# High Molecular Weight DNA Extraction of _Porites asteroides_ with the Qiagen Genomic Tip for Intended Genome Sequencing

In this protocol I use the [QIAGEN Genomic-tip 100/G](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/qiagen-genomic-tip-100g/#orderinginformation), the [QIAGEN Genomic DNA Buffer Set](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/blood-and-cell-culture-dna-midi-kit/#orderinginformation), [QIAGEN RNase A (100mg/mL concentration)](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/lab-essentials/enzymes/rnase-a/?clear=true#orderinginformation), and [QIAGEN Proteinase K](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/lab-essentials/enzymes/qiagen-proteinase-k/?clear=true#orderinginformation)


This is from the successful attempt at extracting, the day before there was an unsuccessful attempt

### Sample Chiseling

**Set up**

- Prepared buffer with 9.5mL of Buffer G2 and 19ul of RNase A
- Set incubator genie to 50 degrees C
- Cleaned chisel, forceps, scraper/scooper and bench with 10% bleach, DI water, then 70% EtOH
- Wrapped those in foil and placed in -80
- Also placed mortar and pestle in -80
- Had styrofoam cooler of dry ice saved and LN2 in the Thermoflask dewar
- Brought over scale
- Set up dry ice box with plastic box rack over the ice to have a hard surface for chiseling, then covered that in foil  

**Chiseling**

- Amy Zyck helped by holding the nubbin (literally unable to chisel without someone holding it)
- Took out nubbin: TA HOT 1 and unwrapped from foil (sample was flash frozen and kept at -80)
- Chiseled with large chisel and hammer until a few chunks came off
- Put mortar on the scale and tarred
- Used forceps to put chunks into mortar: 0.11g
- Decided to do a few more chunks (kit recommends 100mg, but hard to say how much skeleton I'm getting and how much will get scrapped out of the mortar)
- While chiseling again added LN2 to mortar to keep original chunks chilled
- Final weight 0.18g
- Poured LN2 into mortar and let boil off
- Ground chunks with pestle until powdery
- Scrapped into a chilled 50mL conical with the spatula
- Poured in the buffer G2 mix
- Vortexed briefly and placed in incubator genie 10 speed

**_Noticed ~45 min in that I forgot to add the pro K! Took conical out of the incubator and also noticed that it seemed to be leaking! There was liquid in the incubator, a few mL gone? Quick poured liquid into a new conical and added 500ul of pro k, vortexed and put back into the incubator for another 1.5 hours. This is longer than in the protocol but I was worried about there not being enough time to digest._**

### Genomic Tip Extraction

**Genomic Tip**

- Set centrifuge to 4 degrees C
- After incubation, transferred 1mL into each of 8 1.5mL tubes with wide bore pipette tips (some liquid had been lost)
- Centrifuged at 4 degrees C for 10 minutes at 5000 rcf
- Set up tip (resin column) inside a holder over a 50mL conical
- While that was going, added 4mL of buffer to the tip and let drip through to the conical (took the 10 min)
- After centrifugation, added the supernatant from the sample tubes (there was a small brown pellet in each tube) to the tip with  wide bore pipette tip
- Started at 11:18 and was finished dripping at 11:31!
- Changed 50mL waste conicals
- Added 7.5mL of buffer QC (wash) and let drip through (10min)
- Warmed 5mL of buffer QF in incubator genie to 50 degrees C
- Repeated wash addition
- Transferred to a different 50mL conical
- Added the 5mL of warmed buffer QF and let drip through

**Isopropanol Precipitation of DNA**

- Made 6 1.5mL tubes each with 833ul of the elution liquid
- Added 583ul (0.7 volumes) of room temp 100% isopropanol to each tube
- Gently inverted to mix
- Centrifuged at 10,000 rcf for 30 minutes at 1 degree C
- Made fresh 70% EtOH and placed in -20 freezer
- Once finished, looked for pellets. Couldn't see any, but could be glassy/clear
- One tube at a time, removed supernatant, leaving a little to protect potential pellets
- One tube at a time, added 1mL of cold 70% EtOH and vortexed briefly
- Centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4 degrees C 10,000 rcf
- Removed all of supernatant when finished. This time there was a small tan-ish supernatant visible
- Let tubes air dry ~7 minutes
- Added 100ul of TE bufer to each of the 6 tubes very gently
- Incubated for 1hr at 55 degrees C in the Theremomixer
- Once done, transferred to a shaker overnight 300rpm

**QC**

- Broad Range Qubit next day
- Flicked tube and took from both top T and bottom B

|Standard 1|Standard 2|Sample|Average DNA ng/Âµl|
|---|----|----|----|
|151 RFU|21281 RFU|1 T|6.6|
|-|-|1 B|6.56|
|-|-|2 T|6.28|
|-|-|2 B|6.54|
|-|-|3 T|6.5|
|-|-|3 B|7.1|
|-|-|4 T|6.65|
|-|-|4 B|7.4|
|-|-|5 T|6.5|
|-|-|5 B|6.5|
|-|-|6 T|too low|
|-|-|6 B|too low|

Well, the yield is kind of low, or at least not what I was hoping for. If say they're 6ng/ul and you multiply that by 97ul and 5 tubes, that's about 3ug of DNA. Not the 25ug we need.

What about the quality?

Amazing quality! Just have to extract more!
