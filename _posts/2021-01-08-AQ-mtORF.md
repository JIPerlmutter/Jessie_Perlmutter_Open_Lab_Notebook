# Sampling of 2 Pocilloporid Corals From the Aquarium Room, DNA Extraction, mtORF Amplification, and Sanger Sequencing Prep for Species Determination

**Goal**: Extract DNA from these two family Pocilloporidae corals and amplify them for the mtORF region, then prepare the amplifications for sequencing  
**Result**: Good yields from extraction, and good yields from amplification  
**Major takeaways**: Clipping directly into DNA/RNA shield was a good idea, I should have done a gel of the extraction even though I was time limited because that is good practice

## Sampling and DNA Extraction

Using the [Zymo Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus kit](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/company-protocols/_d4068_d4069_quick-dna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) and glass [bead tubes](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/bead-tube-2ml-0-5mm-glass-50pk/15340152) on two samples. Sample 1 is a _Pocillopora_ coral and Sample 2 is a _Stylophora_ coral.

- Made 2 1.5mL tubes, and used 1 bead tube to transfer half the beads into each 1.5mL tube
- Added 500ul of DNA/RNA shield into each tube
- Sterilzed clippers with 10% bleach, DI, and 70% etoh (before and between corals)
- Clipped chunk of coral directly into bead tube and replaced back into the tank in the AQ room

## mtORF Amplification Cleanup and Sequencing Prep

Followed the [mtORF Amplification Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/mtORF-protocol/) exactly, except a TapeStation was run on the samples after cleanup instead of a gel.  
Briefly:

- Diluted samples to 10ng/ul in 10ul:
  - 1: 2.525ul of DNA and 7.475ul 10mM Tris HCl
  - 2. 3.97ul of DNA and 6.03ul 10mM Tris HCl
- Master mix for triplicate reactions + one control:
  - 150ul phusion amplification mix
  - 3.9ul of FatP6 primer (10uM)
  - 3.9ul of RORF primer (10uM)
  - 132ul ultra pure water
- Aliquoted 97ul into 1 tube for each sample and 32ul into one tube for the control
- Added 3ul of diluted DNA into respective 97ul tubes
- Vortexed and spun down
- Split up 100ul tubes into 6 33ul tubes
- Added 1ul ultra pure water to the control tube
- Spun down tubes
- Placed in the thermocyler FATP RORF program
- Afterwards, combined triplicate samples and added 100ul of KAPA Pure Beads for a 1X clean up, 33ul for the control
- Performed normal cleanup
- Eluted in 50ul of ultra pure water
- Qubit of amplified DNA ([protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)):
