# Trying RNA Extraction for Israel with Zymo Kit for _Porites asteroides_ Samples

In this Extraction I used: [Zymo DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-rna-kits/products/quick-dna-rna-miniprep-plus-kit), and Kevin Wong's Protocols [1](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/20201027-DNA-RNA-Extractions-Porites-July-Bleaching-Experiment/) [2](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/DNA-RNA-Extractions-Porites-astreoides-homogenates,-larvae,-and-adult-fragments/).

**Goal**: Extract high quality RNA out of these 3 samples to send to Israel  
**Result**: It worked! A good amount and good quality of RNA for each sample  
**Major Take Aways**: Using Kevin's protocol really worked! I may not have gotten enough RNA but it is all fairly good quality, might need to do R33 again.


## Sample Preparation

- Samples:
  - R33 201907 A2 Molec
  - R13 201907 A2 Molec
  - R15 201907 A2 Molec
- Added 0.25 mL of glass beads (0.5mm) and add 500 μl of RNA/DNA shield into each empty centrifuge tube.
- Took samples out from -80 °C on dry ice.
- Used sterile clippers, added chu k tissue into the centrifuge tube with beads and RNA/DNA shield.
- Vortexed at max speed for 2 minutes.
- Removed 400 μl of the supernatant and transfer to a new centrifuge tube.
- Centrifuged at 9000 rcf for 3 minutes.
- Transferred 300 μl supernatant to a new centrifuge tube and discarded the pellet.
- Added 30 μl of Proteinase K digestion buffer (10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer), and 15 μl of Proteinase K (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K) to each sample.
- Vortexed and spin down.
- Added 345 μl of lysis buffer.
- Continued with DNA and RNA extraction protocol

### DNA Extraction

- Flicked and inverted tubes to mix and spun down
- Warmed 10mM Tris HCl pH 8 and ultra pure water in the thermomixer at 55 degrees C
- Added 700ul of the liquid to yellow spin columns and collection tubes
- Centrifuged 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Saved the flow through in new 5mL tubes
- Repeated addition, centrifugation, and saving of flowthrough for the remaining amount of liquid (3 total spins)
- Added 400ul DNA/RNA prep buffer to the yellow spin columns
- Centrifuged 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Discarded flow through (Zymo kit waste)
- Added 700ul DNA/RNA wash buffer to the yellow spin columns
- Centrifuged 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Discarded flow through (Zymo kit waste)
- Added 400ul DNA/RNA wash buffer to the yellow spin columns
- Centrifuged 16,000rcf for **2 minutes**
- Transferred spin columns to new 1.5mL tubes for each sample labeled as final DNA tubes
- Discarded flow through and collection tubes
- Added 50ul warmed 10mM Tris HCl to the spin columns gently by dripping over the filter
- Incubated at room temp for 5 minutes
- Centrifuged 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Added another 50ul warmed 10mM Tris HCl to the spin columns gently by dripping over the filter
- Incubated at room temp for 5 minutes
- Centrifuged 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Discarded the spin columns
- Made strip tubes with 7ul of each sample in them for QC
- Kept tubes on ice bucket then stored in -20 degree freezer

### RNA Extraction

- Added equal volume (1450ul) 100% ethanol to the 5mL tubes of flowthrough
- Vortexed and spun down
- Added 700ul of the liquid to green spin columns and collection tubes
- Centrifuged 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Discarded flow through (Zymo kit waste)
- Repeated addition, centrifugation, and saving of flowthrough for the remaining amount of liquid (5 total spins)
-  Added 400ul DNA/RNA wash buffer to the green spin columns
- Centrifuged 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Discarded flow through (Zymo kit waste)
- Created the DNase mix:
  - 75ul DNA digestion buffer * 3 = 225ul
  - 5ul DNase I * 3 = 15ul
- Flicked and spun down mix
- Added 80ul DNAse mix to each green spin column filter
- Incubated for 15 minutes at room temp
- Added 400ul DNA/RNA prep buffer to the green spin columns
- Centrifuged 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Discarded flow through (Zymo kit waste)
- Added 700ul DNA/RNA wash buffer to the green spin columns
- Centrifuged 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Discarded flow through (Zymo kit waste)
- Added 400ul DNA/RNA wash buffer to the green spin columns
- Centrifuged 16,000rcf for **2 minutes**
- Transferred spin columns to new 1.5mL tubes for each sample labeled as final RNA tubes
- Discarded flow through and collection tubes
- Added 50ul warmed ultra pure water to the spin columns gently by dripping over the filter
- Incubated at room temp for 5 minutes
- Centrifuged 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Added 50ul warmed ultra pure water to the spin columns gently by dripping over the filter
- Incubated at room temp for 5 minutes
- Centrifuged 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Discarded the spin columns
