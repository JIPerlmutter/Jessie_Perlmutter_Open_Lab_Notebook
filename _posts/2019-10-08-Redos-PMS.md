title: Troubleshoot and Redo Some Samples for Methylation Comparison With Pico Methyl Seq Library Prep Kit
tags: [ DNA, Methylation, Library Prep, WGBS, Methylation Compare ]
---

## Additional amplifications of already made libraries and two re-tries of the full library prep with samples from the [previous post](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/meth-comp-PMS/). Using the [Zymo Pico Methyl Seq Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/pico-methyl-seq-library-prep-kit) for the purpose of comparing to RRBS preparations

#### Re-Amplification on 10-2-19
Original amplifications of library preps could have been low for all samples because we added too much primer (see primer dimer present in all sample traces in previous post). All samples except WGBS 1471 were amplified again and then bead cleaned to be sure to remove any primer dimer. Samples were also bead cleaned before amplification to ensure remaining primer was not inhibiting anything.

**1X bead clean**
- 11µl of KAPA pure beads to each sample (1X)
- Performed normal clean up with fresh 80% EtOH
- Resuspended and eluted in 12µl of DNA elution buffer from the Pico Methyl-Seq kit

**Re-amp**

- Some already made libraries needed more amplification than others, they were split into an extra 4 cycle PCR or extra 2 cycle PCR
- The same index primers were used but only 0.5µl of each were added this time
- Set up new strip tubes with:

|Sample|vol library needed|vol lib amp master mix|vol i5 index|vol i7 index|# of cycles|
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
|1041 WGBS|12µl|13µl|.5µl 1|.5µl 1|4|
|1101 WGBS|12µl|13µl|.5µl 10|.5µl 11|4|
|1101 Captured MBD|12µl|13µl|.5µl 16|.5µl 16|4|
|1548 Captured MBD|12µl|13µl|.5µl 17|.5µl 17|4|
|1628 Captured MBD|12µl|13µl|.5µl 18|.5µl 18|4|
|1637 WGBS|12µl|13µl|.5µl 3|.5µl 3|2|
|1548 WGBS|12µl|13µl|.5µl 11|.5µl 10|2|
|1628 WGBS|12µl|13µl|.5µl 12|.5µl 12|2|
|1041 Captured MBD|12µl|13µl|.5µl 7|.5µl 7|2|
|1471 Captured MBD|12µl|13µl|.5µl 8|.5µl 8|2|
|1637 Captured MBD|12µl|13µl|.5µl 9|.5µl 9|2|

- PCR programs were copied from the last amplification program in the Pico Methyl-Seq protocol and # of cycles was adjusted

**After-amp 1X bead clean**
- 26µl of KAPA pure beads to each sample (1X)
- Performed normal clean up with fresh 80% EtOH
- Resuspended and eluted in 14µl of DNA elution buffer from the Pico Methyl-Seq kit
- Ran D5000 [tapestation](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/tapestation_pdfs/2019-10-03%20-%2014.36.50.pdf)  
![TS]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/reamp.png "TS")
- 1041 WGBS looks like it didn't amplify well again

#### Re-Library prep 1041 and 1471 WGBS

- Re-doing the library prep for 1041 which did not amplify well and 1471 which did not work at all
- Followed exact same steps as in [this library prep](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/meth-comp-PMS/) except did a 1X bead clean up after final amplification instead of doing the DCC
- Ran D5000 [Tapestation](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/tapestation_pdfs/2019-10-04%20-%2015.55.47.pdf)  
![TS2]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/methcomp-redo2.png "TS2")
- Once again 1471 WGBS did not work

#### One more try of 1471 WGBS and re-do of 1101 and 1548 WGBS with _correct paired_ indexes this time

- Re-diluteded i5 #2 and i7 #2 indexes to 10uM to see if the primers were the issue
- Followed exact same steps as in [this library prep](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/meth-comp-PMS/) except did a 1X bead clean up after final amplification instead of doing the DCC
  - 1101 WGBS now has paired #10 i5i7 indexes and 1548 now has paired #11 i5i7 indexes
- Ran D5000 [Tapestation](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/tapestation_pdfs/2019-10-08%20-%2015.51.21.pdf)
