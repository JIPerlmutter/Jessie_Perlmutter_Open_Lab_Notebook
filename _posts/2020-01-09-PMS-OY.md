## Using the [Zymo Pico Methyl Seq Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/pico-methyl-seq-library-prep-kit) on the [MBD enriched](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Methylminer-Oy/) Eastern Oyster DNA from samples from Rebecca Stevick

### Dilution of MBD enriched DNA samples 2020-01-08

While we haven't tested this kit on oyster DNA, my plan was to start with 1ng input DNA into the kit like what has worked for coral DNA. First the samples had to be diluted 1:2 to avoid pipetting less than a µl of DNA

|Sample|volume DNA|volume ultra pure water|
|----|----|---|
|1|5|10|
|2|5|10|
|3|5|10|
|4|5|10|
|5|5|10|
|6|5|10|
|7|5|10|
|8|5|10|
|9|5|10|
|10|5|10|
|11|5|10|
|12|5|10|

### Sample Prep for PMS

Samples need to all include 1ng of sample, .05ng spike-in, and water up to 20µl

|sample|volume DNA|volume diluted spike|volume ultra pure water to 20µl|
|----|----|-----|----|
|1|1.3µl|2µl|16.7µl|
|2|1.2µl|2µl|16.8µl|
|3|1.7µl|2µl|16.3µl|

Not great concentrations, and we are out of DNA screen tapes. But it probably worked fine and just needs to be amplified further.
