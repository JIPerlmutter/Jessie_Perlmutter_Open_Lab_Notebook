# Re-TapeStation the Genomic Tip _Porites lobata_ HMW DNA Extraction Products for Better Visualization

**Goal**: Re-run the tapestation because the ladder missed the first peak in the previous run. Also wanted to dilute the sample some because the tape may have been overloaded previously (ex samples at 400ng/ul)  
**Results**: The ladder worked this time, and results look similar as the previous tape  
**Major Takeaways**: I think the software is better able to calculate the mean size in the large peak better with the ladder by having an upper bound. Pretty much all of the averages got lower the second run, but I think that the sample is the same, it is just better able to quantify the size.


[Extraction](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/pl-hmw/) of the "Porites 6" coral had a poor tapestation run because the ladder used was old. I ran it again using a different ladder tube, and ran twice just in case one didn't work (see two ladders below). Additionally I diluted the DNA 1:2 because the concentration is so high (~400ng/ul) so potentially the tape was overloaded before. 4ul of of ultra pure water was combined with 2ul of DNA for dilution.

Overview of all the results, there is still smearing at the lower bp present.

These are the same extraction tube, the first was run today, and the second was run after the extraction (run with faulty ladder). The distributions look the same, the mean size in the peak is quantified smaller for today's run. This is likely because it has the 48,000bp ladder position.
