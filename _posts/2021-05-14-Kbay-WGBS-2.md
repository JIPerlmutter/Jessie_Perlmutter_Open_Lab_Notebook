# Using the Zymo Pico Methyl Seq Library Prep Kit For Another 12 _Montipora_ DNA Samples from KBay Project

**Goal** Continue library prep for this project, resuspend final libraries in a larger volume  
**Results** All libraries worked, the concentrations are  high  
**Takeaways** Looks like 35ul is a good volume to resuspend the final libraries in, the TS is not overloaded. Some of the peaks are broad but I don't know how to troubleshoot that if it's a problem  

### This library prep followed the closely [the protocol for the Zymo Pico Methyl Seq Kit from me](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/WGBS-PMS-protocol/). See that protocol for detailed descriptions of each steps. Tables and values specific for this prep are included below.

#### Bisulfite Conversion

- Followed exact steps as in protocol
- Put samples in fridge overnight

#### Post-BS Conversion cleanup 20210510
- Followed exact steps as in the protocol

#### Amplification with Prep-Amp Primers
- Followed exact steps as in the protocol
- Priming Master Mix calculations (PMM):
  - 2ul PrepAmp Buffer * 12.3 = 24.6ul
  - 1ul PrepAmp Primer * 12.3 = 12.3ul
- PrepAmp Master Mix calculations (PAMM):
  - 1ul PrepAmp Buffer * 12.3 = 12.3ul
  - 3.75ul PrepAmp PreMix * 12.3 = 46.12ul
  - 0.3ul PrepAmp Polymerase * 12.3 = 3.69ul
- Dilution calculation of PrepAmp Polymerase to add 0.5ul:
  - 0.3 PrepAmp Polymerase * 12.3 = 3.69ul
  - 0.2ul DNA elution buffer * 12.3 = 2.46ul

#### DNA Clean and Concentrator
- Followed exact steps as in the protocol

#### First Amplification  
- Followed exact steps as in the protocol
- 1st Amp Master Mix calculation:
  - 12.5ul Library Amp Mix * 12.3 = 153.75ul
  - 1ul Library Amp Primers * 12.3 = 12.3ul

#### Second DNA Clean and Concentrator
- Followed exact steps as in the protocol

#### Second Amplification with Index Primers
- Followed exact steps as in the protocol, except I used the KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready Mix instead of the Library Amp Mix and I used only 13ul of it, and that the indexes had been combined so I only used 1ul of the combined indexes
