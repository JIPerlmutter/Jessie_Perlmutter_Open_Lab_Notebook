### Post bisulfite conversion samples from [Previous Post](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/MethylMiner-test/) hardly lost size at all, need to try again with a longer sonication.

Original sonication test tried 5 and 10 minute sonications, 10 minutes were much closer to 200-300 base pair ranges. This is what I tried with samples [221](https://echille.github.io/E.-Chille-Open-Lab-Notebook/Acropora-Larvae-DNA-RNA-Extraction-Batch-2/) and [1431](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-06-06-Testing-Soft-and-Hard-Homogenization-Protocol.md) because there were more aliquots of 1Âµg ready for other shear tests.

**Shearing Settings:**  30 seconds on 30 seconds off pulse setting, amplitude 25%, and 10 minute time setting. [Protocol for shearing](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qsonica/) was followed exactly.


  Directly after shearing, samples were put into the [Invitrogen Methylminer Methylated DNA Enrichment Kit](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/ME10025). Because there were two samples again, exact steps from the [previous post](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/MethylMiner-test/) were followed, with the sample volumes.

  _Note: During wash of MBD beads pre-capture reaction one wash was longer than 5 minutes. Also time in -80 pre-precipitation was ~4 hours_

  After DNA re-suspension, HS Qubit was run, and samples pre and post enrichment were run on the D5000 TapeStation tape.

The "sizes" are larger in the captured peaks than the sheared, but I think that mostly has to do with inaccuracy at sizing something at such a low concentration.
