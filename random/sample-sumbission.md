### RNA to send to sequencing

1. Calculate the volume of sample needed for the amount specified by the sequencing company for each of your samples. For Genewiz, look at their [sample submission guidelines](https://www.genewiz.com/en/Public/Resources/Sample-Submission-Guidelines/Next-Generation-Sequencing-Sample-Submission-Guidelines) interactive site to see what they require to send. For RNA (either standard or strand-specific) and total RNA submission they require 500-2000ng of RNA for each sample. The minimum is 500ng. You should send the same amount for each sample
2. Thaw samples on ice and keep on ice the whole time
3. For less than 36 samples they should be in 1.5mL tubes. For more than 36 samples they want them in a 96 well plate (but we have sent individual tubes before so they will take it)
4. Use filter tips to aliquot the correct volumes of sample into their tube
5. Label the tube on the top and on the side with the sample name only (the name/number from your experimental set up)
6. Parafilm the lid for extra protection with a small strip of parafilm
7. Keep them on ice again and if waiting to ship them put them back into the -80
8. When they are shipped they need to be either on dry ice or in a dry shipper
9. When ready to ship, place all the samples in a ziploc bag with the account/PO/project number, Hollie Putnam, University of Rhode Island, X# Samples for RNASeq Total RNA written on the outside of the bag (if you need multiple bags write that one each of them)
10. Prepare the sample sheet to send to genewiz [example sheet](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/random/genewiz-30-191176414-Aug-26-19.csv) (they will send you the sheet to fill out)
11. Print out the sample sheet write the same thing (account/PO/project number, Hollie Putnam, University of Rhode Island, X# Samples for RNASeq Total RNA) on it, put it in it's own ziploc bag and put it in the same shipping container as the samples. In the ziploc protects it from getting wet
12. Ship via overnight UPS shipping
13. Respond to Genewiz email with a copy of the excel sample sheet, the tracking number, and describe how the samples are shipped (in tubes, parafilm, in a labeled bag, or in a plate, etc). Basically I give them as much detail on how they are shipped and their conditions so there is no room for confusion
